#+TITLE: How to create a multi-chapter slide deck for a lecture series 

Using emacs org mode and LaTeX beamer to produce a multi-chapter lecture series 

* History 

This setup grew out of experience with teaching two lecture series (Distributed Systems and Programming 101) using Org mode and Beamer. While overall a great experience, it seemed like some addition structure would be useful. Here is an attempt to provide a versatile setup to support anybody using such a setup for teaching. 

* Structure 

** Individual chapters 

- Each chapter gets one directory 
- Recommend: do NOT put a chapter number in any directory or file names
  - It becomes a pain if you want to switch order at some point
  - Examples: ch_org for organizational material

*** Files per chapter 

- Header: ch_org.org
  - Usually, no need to touch it directly
  - Just used to generate PDF 
- Actual content: ch_org_content.org
- Symbolic links to tex file; just used to make Makefile simpler 

*** Subdirectories
  - figures - for figures that cannot be regenerated (or not easily) 
  - standalone - figures that can be generated, typically based on LaTeX and TiKZ using the standalone package 


** book 

- Contains file to include all the chapters into a single document
- Produced via beamerarticle 
- Change the TITLE in book/book.org! 

* How to add a new chapter 

Strongly recommended: use newChapter.sh ! 

Parameters: 
- -l: Lecture Name 
- -c: Name for the new chapter 
- -n: Number for the chapter 
- -r: Label for the chapter, used in \label, directory name and file name 




* Setup 

** emacs / org-mode

- If you want to produced tex files manually, and not via the Makefile: You need to make sure that xr-hyper appears before hyperref in the tex file 
  - Else, cross-referencing to other documents does not work
  - Compare file:templates/emacs_init.el 
  - Easiest way to do that is customize org-latex-default-packages-alist by adding xr-hyper just before hyperref 
- Also, turn off automatically generated hyperref preamble 

** Latex 

- Obviously, you need an up-to-date LaTeX installation with Beamer
